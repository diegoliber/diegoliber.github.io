I am a software engineer and eternal apprentice in the art and science of computing, in a very passionate way :-). I have great interest in software engineering, agile methodologies, devops and infrastructure automation, think in distributed computing as a very intriguing and fascinating topic, and love using and working with FOSS and I am obsessed with problem solving.

I expect that you enjoy this space, for I will share with you my ramblings and thoughts about technology. Feel free to contact me and engage with discussions whenever you feel to do so.
