It's been a time since the first time I wanted to write down my thoughts on technology and related subjects, but I always found an "excuse" to postpone for tomorrow >.<. Some of these excuses were forgivable, after all, conciliating personal life, a job and obligations of a grad student at the same time is not for the faint of heart. After some sleepless nights I finally have some time to dedicate to a new project!

For starters, let me introduce myself. I am a professional software developer (or engineer, since people in the area think it's a more empowering term. I personally don't care about the difference). I'm interested in technology since the first time I saw an intel 386 personal computer running DOS operating system. From my childhood to the late teenage years, I always used the computers for gaming, researching and school projects. Ocasionally, I'd make a few scripts, some code in Pascal, some html pages, hack in windows, messing with RPG Maker etc but nothing sophisticated. My first significant inroad in computer science happened after I read an article on the newspaper about Linux, and how a group of hackers defied Microsoft dominance. After that, I read an article titled "[How to become a hacker][hacker]", by Eric S. Raymond, that simply blew my mind and introduced me to the "hacker way". Since them, I started coding in C, chose Computer Engineering for my college major, started using Linux for my main OS, became a user of FOSS and much happened since them.

Although I have academic training in computing-related stuff, I always preferred getting my hands dirty and studying independently. I spent my time learning different programming languages (C, then C++, Java, Python, a few PHP and Ruby, some Javascript), learning some concepts of computing like concurrency, compiler theory, network programming. I actually prefer learn things by doing rather than just listening to lectures and doing theoretical exercises. So, I'll do my best to provide practical examples and code from every discussion we have in this place.

My main area of interest is distributed systems. I always liked the idea of a bunch of computers working together. Distributed Systems is a very complex domain, but at the same time, full of possibilities. It's possible to discover innovations in the area every day. Be it web sites and apps, file sharing, mobile, big data, multi-player games, cloud computing or internet of things, the concepts of distributed systems are at the core. Since I'm passionate about this subject, expect some discussion about distributed systems and its applications.

But software, be it distributed or not, is challenging to build and a nightmare to maintain. Therefore we, software developers, must be constantly refining our skills and become more disciplined in order to deliver good quality products. Because of this, I'm constantly trying to learn topics that will help me improve as a developer, like TDD, BDD, infrastructure automation and the like. I'll share my learnings with you!

My intention as a writer of this blog is to help people who are facing the same problems I did, since I learn a lot by reading articles from another people in the same fashion. Although there are other environments for this type of talk, like Quora and Stackoverflow, I feel I have much more liberty to say what I want using this medium.

I'll try to write at least one time per month, but the frequency will depend on my available time. I'm still learning to use Jekyll and github pages, so expect me to make repairs and improvements while the plane is still flying. I also apologize beforehand for my writing, English is not my first language. As a common saying where I came from, when we teach we learn twice. Finally, I'm always trying to not be an arrogant or over confident prick, so whenever I say something silly, just comment or mail me.
